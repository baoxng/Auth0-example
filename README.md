## Description
The Breakroom is a fun site that allows users to sign up and play fun games. It gives them 15 minutes to play whichever games they like, and then automatically signs them out, which is great for breaks during work. It allows users to get a bit of downtime in the day, and also gives them a chat function to speak if they so wish. 

## Inspiration
The three of us all wanted to create a fun app that anyone could enjoy. We also are all big fans of games, so we wanted to do something relating to that. We wanted our app to be unique, too. Eventually, we all agreed upon an app that would be useful to use during work breaks, so we wanted a timer to be part of the app as well. We also agreed that being able to chat with other users would be very fun, so we decided on that as well. Our app does a good job of allowing users to relax and have a good time, and we're all glad to have been able to make it.
